            // works only inside async functions
            let result = await promise; // wait until the promise resolves (*)

            alert(result); // "done!"

            //The function execution “pauses” at the line (*) and resumes when the promise settles, with result becoming its result. So the code above shows “done!” in one second.
            //It’s just a more elegant syntax of getting the promise result than promise.then, easier to read and write.
